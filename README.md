### About
Real Estate Sellers used to advertise their properties on newspapers like Classifieds and allow potential buyers to contact the buyer through various contact numbers mentioned in the advertisement. Sellers would also try to hire brokers in hopes of getting their property sold at a good rate. However, in the recent decade with the advancement of technology, most of the real estate business is done on websites like  www.99acres.com ,  www.magicbricks.com . BroAcre.com intends to be a more powerful real estate website with powerful recommendations for buyers based on location, cost, distance from hospitals, metro stations, etc, amenities and for sellers to know the best price to sell their property for, advice from experts and a forum for any customer queries among other features. The green cover of locality, photo sharing and Vastu Compliance feature will also look at customer satisfaction before visiting the site.
